## HyperResilient: Hyperparameter Optimization for Cross Framework Model Robustness

An implementation of automated hyperparameter tuning which results in model consistency across frameworks in addition to robustness to noise attacks. Utilizes hyperspace and ray tune for hyperparameter search.

Subproblems:
- MNIST, simple classification perceptron
- CIFAR100, AlexNet architecture
- Cityscapes, UNet ResNet34 Architecture
